# Ireland_EJPR_2018
Replications files for "How Catchall Parties Compete Ideologically: Beyond Party Typologies" (European Journal of Political Research, 2018, With Sean McGraw).

Due to the sensitivity of the data, obtained from interviews with Irish TDs (members of parliament), we are not able to share original data. We have instead uploaded fake replication data, including syntax for generating this data. Note that the fake data has so far only been briefly tested. We are conducting further tests at the moment. The syntax to generate the fake replication currently depends on the real data. We are working to fix this issue.

Since the article was accepted for publication, we have cleaned up some of the R syntax to reflect better coding practices. The cleaned-up syntax is arguably over-engineered, and was done mostly as a personal exercise.
